    <p>This page lets you register an account for GoonSwarm. If you are already a member of the alliance this will grant you access to our internal services immediately.</p>
    <p>Note that the character you register with will be your username and internal identity,
      we will probably not help you change it later because <img src="<%= static_url(@conn, "/images/effort.gif") %>" alt="Ugh, that button ..."> </p>
    <p>You do not need to register new accounts for alts.</p>
